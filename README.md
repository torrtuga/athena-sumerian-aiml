 ## AIML Dialogue System
 
 1. Create an AWS EC2 instance and select the Ubuntu server.
 2. Copy the AIML folder to the EC2 server using an FTP service like FileZilla or the command scp which stands for secure copy.
 3. Install following : 
    * `pip install aiml`
    * `pip install Flask`
    * `pip install Flask-Cors`
    * `pip install gunicorn`
    * `pip install vaderSentiment`
    * `sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev nginx`
 4. Letâ€™s check if nginx . has been installed and running. Open your browser and run input your instances public IP . address.
 5. Remove the default nginx pages by running the command :
    * `sudo rm /etc/ningx/sites-enabled/default`
    * `sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
 6. Configure nginx to proxy our trafic to port 8000. Create a config file in sites-available and add a symlink to the sites-enabled in nginx.
   ```
   sudo touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysitename.com
  sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /etc/nginx/sites-   available/mysitename.com
  ```
 7. Open the mysitename.com file or whatever you named it and paste the contents below (make sure you give your domain name)
    ```
    server {
      listen 80;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;
       }
      }
     ```
 8. Create a symlink now. Run the following commands.
    ```
    sudo ln -f -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/brightevents.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/mysitename.com
    sudo service nginx restart
